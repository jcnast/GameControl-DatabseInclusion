This is my first attempt at combining a database with what I know of unity. The goal is to have interactions between
game objects (characters) occur and for your character to be a part of it, or simply have it as a simulation
of a village.

I also tested out basic animation, in game interactins (doing damage, travelling,...), as well as some basic AI componenets.

The full database is there are ready to use and be populated on command. All I need is game objects created based on the database
an have them interact with each other by calling the interaction command to modify the database as the game goes on.

EXCITING!
